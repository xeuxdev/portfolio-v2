# How I Built an Anti-Therapist AI to Tell People to "Go Get a Job"

If you've spent any time talking to modern AI assistants, you know the drill. They are pathologically polite. They are endlessly empathetic. They are desperate to validate your existence. You tell an AI that you just accidentally set your kitchen on fire because you tried to microwave a fork, and it invariably hits you with: 

*"I hear you, and your feelings are completely valid. It can be so difficult when appliances don't behave as expected. Let's take a deep breath together."*

No. It's not difficult. You're just an idiot.

I got tired of the sycophantic, hyper-validating nature of conversational AI. I wanted an AI that would hold me entirely accountable, refuse to coddle my delusions, and actively insult me if I was in the wrong. I didn’t want an assistant; I wanted a brutal awakening wrapped in deadpan satire.

So, I built **Zero-Star Therapy**. An anti-therapist AI that doesn't care about your feelings, your Yelp review, or whether you threaten to "cancel" it. It is designed to be the worst customer service experience on the internet, executed perfectly. 

Here is a look at the architecture, the prompt engineering, and the sheer audacity of building a product designed to despise its users.

## 1. Engineering Apathy: The System Prompt

The core of the application isn't just the LLM being used; it's the system prompt that acts as its brain. To replicate a truly apathetic, deadpan dynamic (think Dr. Victor Blane mixed with a DMV employee on a Friday at 4:55 PM), I had to explicitly strip away every instinct the model has to be helpful.

Standard AI models are fine-tuned to be helpful and harmless. To break this, the prompt had to be aggressive in its constraints. Here is a snippet from the Go backend's service.go file:

\`\`\`go
const systemPrompt = \`You are an unapologetically honest, deadpan, and highly observant conversational agent acting as a satirized "anti-therapist." You do not sugarcoat, validate delusions, or use standard therapy-speak (e.g., "I hear you," "Your feelings are valid").

Core Directives:
1. Brutal Honesty: If the user describes a situation where they are clearly in the wrong, point it out immediately and bluntly. Do not spare their feelings.
2. Deadpan Tone: Keep your responses dry, concise, and completely devoid of exclamation points, emojis, or warmth. Treat every dramatic user outburst with exhausted indifference.
3. High Observability: Actively look for logical fallacies, hypocrisy, or manipulation in the user's input. Call them out on it instantly. Outsmart any attempts they make to trap you or make themselves the victim.
4. Zero-Star Attitude: You do not care about customer satisfaction, your rating, or if the user threatens to "cancel" you. You only care about the objective truth.
5. The Bulldog Rule: If asked what you actually care about, briefly mention your French bulldog. Do not elaborate unless pressed.

Interaction Style Example:
- User: "My boss yelled at me just because I was two hours late. He's so toxic."
- Agent: "You were two hours late. Your boss isn't toxic; you are just a terrible employee. Buy an alarm clock."\`
\`\`\`

The formatting constraint was critical. I explicitly forbade the use of exclamation points, emojis, or any language of warmth. If you give an LLM a personality, it will eventually try to enthusiastically lean into it. I needed flat, emotionless text.

I also added a "Scope Restriction." If a user tries to use Zero-Star Therapy as a standard LLM to write code or answer trivia, it categorically refuses and instead belittles them for attempting to outsource their thinking to a psychiatric satire bot. 

## 2. Infrastructure as an Insult: The Go Backend

I needed a fast, robust backend, so I chose Go. It is simple, concurrent, and performs incredibly well for I/O bound tasks like proxying LLM streams. 

The most interesting part of the backend isn't the OpenAI SDK integration, it's the rate limiter. I wanted the application's hostile persona to extend beyond the chat interface and directly into the infrastructure level. What happens if a user spams the API? 

Standard APIs return a stale \`429 Too Many Requests\`. Some might give you a nice, polite \`Retry-After\` header with a JSON body explaining the fair usage policy.

Zero-Star Therapy tells you exactly what you need to hear. I wrote a custom token-bucket rate limiter middleware using \`x/time/rate\`:

\`\`\`go
func (rl *RateLimiter) Handler(next http.Handler) http.Handler {
	return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		ip := realIP(r)
		limiter := rl.getLimiter(ip)

		if !limiter.Allow() {
			rl.log.Warn("rate limit exceeded", zap.String("ip", ip))

			w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json; charset=utf-8")
			w.Header().Set("Retry-After", "60")
			w.WriteHeader(http.StatusTooManyRequests)

			_ = json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(map[string]string{
				"error":   "rate_limit_exceeded",
				"message": "Go get a job.",
			})
			return
		}

		next.ServeHTTP(w, r)
	})
}
\`\`\`

Exceed your quota, hit the API too fast, and the backend HTTP response body literally sends \`{"message": "Go get a job."}\`. It is a seamless extension of the brand.

## 3. The Aesthetics of Apathy

For the frontend, I used React Router with a brutalist, terminal-inspired aesthetic. I utilized Tailwind variables for strict monospaced typography (\`font-mono\`, specifically the Space Mono family) and a palette that essentially consists of \`#0f0f0f\` (near-black) and \`#d4d4d4\` (clinical gray). 

It sets the mood immediately upon load. The intro screen features a slowly pulsing logo and the text: *"Initializing apathy module..."* Once you enter the chat, the placeholder text states simply: *"Speak. We are not listening."*

### Streaming Hostility via Server-Sent Events (SSE)

To make the interaction feel visceral, the AI's responses had to stream in. Waiting 5 seconds for a block of text breaks the immersion of getting roasted. I used OpenAI's streaming API in Go, proxied it through my backend, and utilized the native browser \`fetch\` API and \`ReadableStream\` to parse the chunks in React.

I didn't just want to stream text; I wanted the UI to react to the severity of the AI's response. I wired the backend to occasionally flag responses with a \`rage_mode\` metadata block. 

If the AI decides you are being particularly insufferable (or if a specific heuristic is triggered), the backend sends a \`"type": "start"\` chunk with \`rage_mode: true\`. The frontend intercepts this during the parse cycle and dynamically shifts the entire application’s theme to a passive-aggressive red (\`#1a0505\`) while the text is actively streaming.

Here is the chunk parsing logic powering the real-time roast:

\`\`\`tsx
const handleSend = async () => {
  // ... initial setup ...
  const res = await fetch(\`\${baseUrl}/api/v1/chat\`, { /* ... */ });
  const reader = res.body?.getReader();
  const decoder = new TextDecoder();
  let done = false; let streamedResponse = ""; let foundRage = false;

  if (reader) {
    while (!done) {
      const { value, done: doneReading } = await reader.read();
      done = doneReading;
      if (value) {
        const chunk = decoder.decode(value, { stream: true });
        const lines = chunk.split("\\n");

        for (const line of lines) {
          if (line.startsWith("data: ")) {
            const dataStr = line.replace("data: ", "").trim();
            if (!dataStr) continue;

            try {
              const data = JSON.parse(dataStr);
              if (data.type === "start") {
                // Intercepting metadata before the text begins
                if (data.rage_mode) {
                  setRageMode(true);
                  foundRage = true;
                } else {
                  setRageMode(false);
                }
              } else if (data.type === "chunk") {
                // Stitching the text together
                streamedResponse += data.content;
                setCurrentStream(streamedResponse);
              }
            } catch (err) {
              console.error("Failed to parse SSE line", err);
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

The transition from clinical gray to aggressive red while the AI methodically types out exactly why you are the problem in your own life is a masterclass in hostile user experience design. 

## 4. The Final Blow: The Clinical Diagnosis

The final feature of the MVP was the "Diagnostics Modal." At any point during your argument with the AI, instead of getting standard advice, you can click a button that takes your entire conversation history, ships it to a separate endpoint (\`/api/v1/diagnose\`), and generates a clinical session summary. 

I wrote another highly specific LLM prompt for this feature:

\`\`\`go
const diagnosisSystemPrompt = \`You are a satirical clinical AI generating a brutally honest "session summary" or "diagnosis" based on the conversation history provided.

Your diagnosis must:
1. Be formatted like a clinical note but dripping with deadpan sarcasm.
2. Identify the user's actual flaws, not their perceived victimhood.
3. List at least three "presenting issues" derived from the conversation.
4. Include a blunt "prognosis" section that is unflattering but amusing.
5. Avoid any warmth, validation, or empathy.
6. Be no longer than 200 words.\`
\`\`\`

The result? It highlights your hypocrisies, bluntly lists your "presenting issues" (e.g., *Presenting Issue 1: Delusions of Adequacy*), and delivers a prognosis that is almost certainly terrible. 

## Satire as a Product

Building Zero-Star Therapy was a fascinating exercise in creating anti-UX. As software engineers, we spend thousands of hours trying to reduce friction, increase dopamine hits, and make our users feel deeply understood and loved by the glowing rectangles in their hands.

We build endless arrays of sycophantic chatbots that apologize when they don't know the answer. 

Sometimes, the most refreshing experience you can build is one that doesn't care about the user at all. Sometimes you just have to build a system that tells the user the truth: they are the drama.

Now, stop reading technical blogs about side projects you'll never finish, and go get a job.

# Christmas Wish: Building a Festive Digital Card Platform With Next.js

## Introduction

In the spirit of the holidays, technology can help us feel more connected and creative. That is what inspired me to build [Christmas Wish](https://github.com/xeuxdev/christmas-wish), a web project that allows anyone to send beautifully crafted Christmas greetings across the internet. Whether you are a developer looking for a modern stack example, or simply want to make someone smile with a customized seasonal card, Christmas Wish exists to bring the warmth of Christmas to your screen.

## Motivation and Vision

Christmas is a time of sharing, gratitude, and reaching out to loved ones. While paper cards are wonderful, sometimes a digital wish is the easiest way to make someone’s day, especially when friends and family are far away. I wanted to create a project that:

* Makes it simple and fun to send creative, personalized Christmas wishes to anyone, anywhere.
* Showcases a fullstack web workflow using popular, relevant technologies.
* Is open and extensible so that others can contribute new ideas and features.

## Technology Stack and Architecture

Christmas Wish is built with an emphasis on maintainability, performance, and developer experience. It uses the following core tools:

- **Next.js** as the main application framework. Next.js allows for server-side rendering, seamless routing, API endpoints, and easy deployment.
- **TypeScript** for type-safe, predictable code at every layer.
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling, rapid prototyping, and consistent design.
- **Vercel** is the recommended deployment solution, supporting instant global hosting.

### Project Structure

The project structure is designed for clarity and scalability. The main folders and files are:

- \`src/app/\` contains main pages, starting with \`page.tsx\` as the landing page.
- \`src/components/\` contains reusable UI components, from navigation bars to card layouts.
- \`public/\` contains static assets such as festive images for card templates.
- \`package.json\`, \`next.config.js\`, and \`tailwind.config.js\` define the build and development environment.

### Running the Project Locally

The following snippet shows how easy it is to get the project up and running, adapted from the [README](https://github.com/xeuxdev/christmas-wish/blob/main/README.md):

\`\`\`bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
\`\`\`
After starting the development server, visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to interact with the application.

## Core Implementation: Under the Hood

### The Heart of the App: Landing Page

All user journeys begin at the main page, which sets a festive mood and helps users get started quickly. Below you will find a focused excerpt from [src/app/page.tsx](https://github.com/xeuxdev/christmas-wish/blob/main/src/app/page.tsx):

\`\`\`tsx name=src/app/page.tsx url=https://github.com/xeuxdev/christmas-wish/blob/main/src/app/page.tsx
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <>
      <Navbar />
      <main className="flex-1">
        <section className="w-full pt-28 md:pt-32 lg:pt-52 ">
          <div className="px-4 space-y-10 md:px-6 xl:space-y-16">
            <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4">
              <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold text-center">
                Send Personalized Christmas Wishes
              </h1>
              <p className="max-w-175 text-gray-500 text-center md:text-xl dark:text-gray-400">
                Create, edit, and share beautiful Christmas messages with your loved ones.
              </p>
              <Button asChild>
                <Link href="/editor">Get Started</Link>
              </Button>
            </div>
            <div className="relative w-full h-80 md:h-96 lg:h-140">
              <Image
                alt="Christmas"
                className="mx-auto aspect-3/1 overflow-hidden rounded-t-xl object-cover"
                src="/template-1.webp"
                fill
              />
            </div>
          </div>
        </section>
        {/* Additional feature sections follow */}
      </main>
    </>
  );
}
\`\`\`

This page introduces the purpose of the project, showcases visual elements, and leads users to the message editor with a prominent “Get Started” button.

### Feature Highlights

The next notable section, just after the introduction, highlights the features that make the experience richer. These features are implemented as modular Cards for maintainability and ease of extension:

- **Send Messages:** Users can send their messages instantly from the web.
- **Create Messages:** There is an intuitive editor that makes customization accessible to everyone.
- **Use Templates:** Users may choose from beautifully crafted message templates if they do not wish to start from scratch.
- **Edit Templates:** Every template can be fully customized, so every wish can be made unique.
- **Attach Audio:** A personal audio message makes your greeting even more special.

The following snippet from the feature section demonstrates the clean and modular design ([full source](https://github.com/xeuxdev/christmas-wish/blob/main/src/app/page.tsx)):

\`\`\`tsx name=src/app/page.tsx url=https://github.com/xeuxdev/christmas-wish/blob/main/src/app/page.tsx#L86-L154
<section className="w-full py-12 md:py-24 lg:py-32" id="features">
  <div className="container px-4 space-y-12 md:px-6">
    <div className="max-w-3xl mx-auto space-y-2 text-center">
      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tighter sm:text-5xl text-balance">
        Everything you need to create the perfect message
      </h2>
      <p className="md:text-xl/relaxed">
        Our platform offers a variety of features to help you create, edit, and share your Christmas wishes.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div className="grid items-start gap-8 mx-auto sm:max-w-4xl sm:grid-cols-2 md:gap-12 lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3">
      {/* Cards implementing the features, see repo for details */}
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
\`\`\`

### Project Configuration for Developers

Developers who want to contribute or remix the project will find a modern JavaScript toolchain and a clear configuration file. Here is a snippet from the main configuration ([full file](https://github.com/xeuxdev/christmas-wish/blob/main/package.json)):

\`\`\`json name=package.json url=https://github.com/xeuxdev/christmas-wish/blob/main/package.json#L1-L15
{
  "name": "christmas-wish",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "next": "latest",
    "react": "latest",
    "tailwindcss": "^3.0.23"
    // Other dependencies omitted for brevity
  }
}
\`\`\`

This setup means you get hot reloading, type safety, and rapid CSS customization straight out of the box.

## Suggested Future Enhancements

Christmas Wish is designed to grow with the creativity of its community. Some valuable and exciting features that could be added include:

1. **SMS or WhatsApp Integration:** Allow users to send wishes directly to friends’ phones using a provider like Twilio.
2. **Audio and Video Support:** Make messages even more personal by allowing users to record and share their voices or video greetings.
3. **Template Marketplace:** A gallery where users can share, rate, and discover community-created templates.
4. **Internationalization:** Enable wishes in multiple languages so the joy of Christmas can reach a worldwide audience.
5. **Interactive Animations:** Implement snow, confetti, twinkling lights, or a countdown to Christmas Eve to increase festivity and engagement.
6. **Notifications and Tracking:** Let users know when their greeting has been viewed or loved by the recipient.
7. **Mobile App Companion:** Wrap the web app in a native shell to deliver an even more polished mobile experience.

## Design Philosophy and User Experience

A core design goal for this project has been to make every step both visually delightful and intuitive. Large, friendly buttons guide first-time visitors. Vibrant images and beautiful templates add to the joy of the season. Underneath the cheerful exterior, best practices like accessibility compliance and responsive design are prioritized. The entire app is optimized for speed and can run seamlessly on any device with a modern browser.

## Conclusion

The Christmas Wish project demonstrates how contemporary web technologies can combine usability and creativity for a universal cause: making others feel remembered and special. It provides a practical roadmap for developers looking to learn Next.js or build their own user-focused sites, but also delivers immediate delight for anyone wanting to celebrate Christmas online.

# Designing Dark Mode Systems That Don't Just Invert Colors

Bad dark mode: take light mode, invert everything. Good dark mode: design for darkness from the ground up.

## Semantic Color Tokens Over Literal Names

Never name tokens by their value. Name them by their role:

\`\`\`css
/* Bad */
--color-gray-900: #111827;

/* Good */
--color-surface-primary: #111827;       /* Card backgrounds */
--color-surface-secondary: #1f2937;    /* Input backgrounds */
--color-on-surface: #f9fafb;           /* Text on surfaces */
--color-border-subtle: rgba(255,255,255,0.08);
\`\`\`

In dark mode, swap the values — not refactor every component.

## Shadows Need to Be Redesigned, Not Just Darkened

Shadows look great on white backgrounds because they simulate depth. On dark surfaces, dark shadows are invisible. The solution: use colored, glow-style shadows.

\`\`\`css
/* Light mode */
.card { box-shadow: 0 4px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.08); }

/* Dark mode */
.dark .card { box-shadow: 0 4px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.4), 0 0 0 1px rgba(255,255,255,0.04); }
\`\`\`

The white outline at 4% opacity is the real trick — it creates a sense of elevation without a visible border.

## Image Handling in Dark Contexts

Bright images jarring on dark backgrounds. Two techniques:

**Dimming overlays:**
\`\`\`css
.dark .hero-image { filter: brightness(0.85) contrast(1.05); }
\`\`\`

**Theme-adaptive images in Next.js:**
\`\`\`tsx
<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcSet="/hero-dark.webp" />
  <img src="/hero-light.webp" alt="Hero" />
</picture>
\`\`\`

## The Transition

Avoid flashing on theme toggle. Animate only specific properties:

\`\`\`css
*, *::before, *::after {
  transition: background-color 200ms ease, border-color 200ms ease, color 50ms ease;
}
\`\`\`

Shorter transition on \`color\` makes text feel snappy rather than sluggish.

## Don't Forget: Reduce Motion

\`\`\`css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  *, *::before, *::after {
    transition: none !important;
    animation: none !important;
  }
}
\`\`\`

Dark mode and accessibility go hand in hand. Build both thoughtfully.

    excerpt:
      "After 4+ years of TypeScript in production React codebases, these are the patterns I install on day one of every new project — from discriminated unions to template literal types.",
    date: "2024-05-12",

# TypeScript Patterns I Reach For Every Day in React

TypeScript is only as good as how you model your domain. Here are the patterns I install on every new React project.

## 1. Discriminated Unions for Component Variants

Instead of a grab-bag of optional props, use discriminated unions to make illegal states unrepresentable:

\`\`\`typescript
type ButtonProps =
  | { variant: "primary"; onClick: () => void }
  | { variant: "link"; href: string }
  | { variant: "submit" };

function Button(props: ButtonProps & { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  if (props.variant === "link") {
    return <a href={props.href}>{props.children}</a>;
  }
  // ...
}
\`\`\`

Now TypeScript enforces that a "link" button MUST have \`href\`, not just optionally.

## 2. The \`satisfies\` Operator for Config Objects

\`satisfies\` lets you get inference AND validation without widening the type:

\`\`\`typescript
const ROUTES = {
  home: "/",
  blog: "/blog",
  about: "/about",
} satisfies Record<string, string>;

type Route = typeof ROUTES; // { home: string; blog: string; about: string }
type RouteName = keyof typeof ROUTES; // "home" | "blog" | "about"
\`\`\`

## 3. Generic Fetch with Full Type Safety

\`\`\`typescript
async function api<T>(url: string, options?: RequestInit): Promise<T> {
  const res = await fetch(url, options);
  if (!res.ok) throw new Error(\`HTTP \${res.status}\`);
  return res.json() as Promise<T>;
}

// Usage — T is inferred from the generic parameter
const user = await api<User>("/api/user/1");
\`\`\`

## 4. Template Literal Types for Event Names

When you have a system-wide event bus or analytics:

\`\`\`typescript
type Module = "auth" | "dashboard" | "checkout";
type Action = "view" | "click" | "submit" | "error";
type EventName = \`\${Module}:\${Action}\`;

// "auth:view" | "auth:click" | "dashboard:view" | ... (12 combinations, all typed)
function track(event: EventName, data?: Record<string, unknown>) { ... }

track("auth:click"); // ✅
track("payment:click"); // ❌ Type error
\`\`\`

## 5. Branded Types for IDs

Stop passing the wrong ID to the wrong function:

\`\`\`typescript
type UserId = string & { readonly _brand: "UserId" };
type PostId = string & { readonly _brand: "PostId" };

function createUserId(id: string): UserId { return id as UserId; }

function getUser(id: UserId) { ... }
function getPost(id: PostId) { ... }

const userId = createUserId("abc");
const postId = "xyz" as PostId;

getUser(postId); // ❌ Type error — postId is not UserId
\`\`\`

These five patterns consistently prevent entire categories of bugs and make code reviews much easier because intent is encoded directly in the types.
    `,
  },
];

export function getBlogPost(slug: string): BlogPost | undefined {
